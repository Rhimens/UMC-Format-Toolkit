The UMC Deck Toolkit is a React App that allows users to:
- View the format banlist
- Search and view cards by name, text, and/or genres such as "Destroy Monster" or "Destroy Spell/Trap"
- Read cards with text accurate to the format, either due to abiding by past text (Goat Format players will be familiar with this) or intentionally abiding by future errata for quality of life
- Build a deck, with banlist violations appearing at the top automatically, and export the list via YDK format to DuelingBook

Ultimate Masters Curated Format is built around the existing Reaper Format and the card pool within the GBA Game Ultimate Masters - World Championship Tournament 2006. Any card printed within either of these two formats is available in UMC. Specifically, all cards printed in the TCG up to and including the Structure Deck: Invincible Fortress, and all cards otherwise available in Ultimate Masters.

For players familiar with this time period in the TCG, you will find notable cards available in this format that were not present at the time, such as *Crush Card Virus, Dandylion, Five-Headed Dragon, Marshmallon*, and *Summoner Monk* - powerful cards that will dramatically change deckbuilding!

UMC aims to create a format built around the following five points that the format creators believe early YuGiOh was close to but never quite managed to stick the landing on offering all at the same time:

**Compelling Gameplay. Interaction. Synergy. Explosivity. Attrition.**

UMC utilizes a curated Banlist with an additional twist. The goal of this system is twofold - to allow homebrew style, ‘kitchen table gameplay’ and ‘playground YuGiOh’ decks to shine in the meta, and to avoid issues while remaining competitive and engaging:
- Homogenization of deckbuilding (i.e. every deck containing the same 10-15 cards)
- Discouraging other card choices (i.e. “Strictly Better” alternatives)
- Excessively oppressing other strategies
- Creating frustrating game states
- Consistent OTK/FTK enablers
