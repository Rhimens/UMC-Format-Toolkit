Please read the Google Doc for an explanation of the format, its goals, and the reasonings behind its card pool and card limit choices.

This toolkit allows for easier deckbuilding in the Ultimate Masters Curated format.
The card pool is precise and includes all overlaps between Ultimate Masters 2006 and Reaper Format.
The banlist (which has several twists on regular Yu-Gi-Oh deckbuilding) is available to view in the toolkit, and also will notify you if any of your deckbuilding choices are in violation of the list.****
